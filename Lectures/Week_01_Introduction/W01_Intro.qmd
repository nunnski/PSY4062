## Why we should NOT trust scientists

-  No “scientific method” that guarantees truth of scientific claims
    -  “Textbook method” not correct
        -  Affirming the consequent
            - Cf. Popper’s falsificationism
        -  Auxiliary hypotheses
        -  Much of science doesn’t follow it

## Why we should NOT trust scientists

-  “Truth” of scientific claims rests on 
    -  Appeal to authority (albeit collective)
    -  Consensus
